# ESP-Rainmaker

In this project we will be working on ESP-IDF and learning about the ESP-Rainmaker

We'll be building a motion sensor device that will detect the motion and update the information on the Rainmaker mobile app. As soon as the Motion is detected it will turn on the LED.

we can also control the LED from the Rainmaker mobile app.
